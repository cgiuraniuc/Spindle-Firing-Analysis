# Spindle-Firing-Analysis
This script automatically analyzes stretch-induced firing in muscle spindle recordings. It detects sustained increases in activity, segments the response into functional phases, and calculates firing rates relative to baseline. Outputs include raw and background-corrected metrics.
There are two versions of the code, one for ramp stretches and another for saw-like stretches and releases.
Although originally written manually prior to the advent of generative AI tools, the code can now be easily adapted by non-specialists using AI assistants such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024), which also produced some of documentation.
